Hi Amedeo,

Your simulations are well configured and are neatly modeled. 
You have same set of methods across the simualations, These could have been moved to a single util/lib and invoked across simulations.
Besides that, Code is nicely documented and is readable.

Your total grade is 7% + 2% = 9% 

Thank you,
Mohammed Siddiq
